# Installation Instructions for labelImg on CentOS 7

1) Ensure Python is installed on your computer (preferrably Python 3). The remaining steps will assume that Python 3 is installed, though I will make note 
where this distinction matters.

2) We will use conda, which allows us to create a Python environment and run labelImg via command line. Install conda.
    (Conda was preinstalled when I first started working on this, so perhaps try following this page:

    linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-anaconda-on-centos-7/

3) Type the following to create a Python environment:
    "conda create -n <my_env>"

4) Make sure the shell is configured for conda:
    "conda init <shell>"

5) To activate the Python environment:
    "conda activate <my_env>"

6) Install pyqt5 (this works for python 3, otherwise install pyqt4):
    "yum install pythonxx-qt5-5.12.1-3.el7.x86_64"
    where xx denotes the Python version number. (Alternatively, you can try "conda install pyqt=5", but I didn't have luck with this)

6.5) I had to install the following to prevent errors later on:
    "pip install lxml"

7) Install labelImg. Navigate to the following link:
    https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg/releases

    Download the latest version (tar.gz, preferrably), then untar using the following command:
    "tar -zxvf labelme**.tar.gz"

8) Navigate to the labelImg folder and type (assuming pyqt5 and python3):
    "make qt5py3"
    This will compile the resources.qrc file and allow you to run the program.

9) Assuming all of the above steps worked successfully, run the following to open labelImg:
    "python labelImg.py"
